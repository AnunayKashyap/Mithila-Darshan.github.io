            <h3> Saurath Sabha </h3>
            <p>Saurath Sabha is a historical village situated approximately 6km northeast of Madhubani in the Madhubani District of Bihar, India. It is famous for its annual gathering of thousands of Maithil Brahman to match couples during the Hindu months of Jyestha-Aasadh. The gathering is organised in an orchard covering 22 acres (bighas) of land, which are said to have been donated by the Maharaja of Darbhanga. It is an important social event in India that is focused on arranged marriages between Maithil men and women according to a reading of their horoscopes by the registrar.
This meeting was started by Raja Harisingh Dev to eliminate the social evils prevalent before marriage in the then society. For this, he had selected 14 meetings, of which Saurath is one.</p>

            <h3> Ugna Mahadev Mandir</h3>
            <p>The matter is sometime around 1360 AD. In those days there used to be a poet in Bisfi village of Bihar. The name of the poet was Vidyapati. Apart from being a poet, Vidyapati was also an exclusive devotee of Lord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion and creations, Lord Shiva wished to live as a servant in his house. One day Lord Shiva came to Vidyapati's house in the guise of a foolish idiot. Shiva told Vidyapati his name as Ugna. Vidyapati's financial condition was not good, so he refused to hire Ugna. But where were the believers of Shiva?

Agreed to work for only two meals a day. On this Vidyapati's wife asked Vidyapati to hire Ugna. Following the advice of his wife, Vidyapati hired Ugna. One day Ugna was going to the king's court with Vidyapati. Due to the scorching heat, Vidyapati's throat started drying up. But there was no water source nearby. Vidyapati told Ugna to arrange water from somewhere else I would die of thirst. Lord Shiva went some distance and opened his hair and brought a lota filled with Ganga water.

When Vidyapati drank the water, he felt the taste of the Ganges water and he was surprised that where even the source of water is not visible in this forest, where did this water come from. That too the water whose taste is like that of the Ganges water. Poet Vidyapati Ugna became suspicious that this is not an ordinary person but Lord Shiva himself, so Ugna started insisting to know his real identity. When Vidyapati called Ugna as Shiva and caught hold of his feet, Ugna had to come in her real form. Lord Shiva himself appeared at the place of growing.

Shiva told Vidyapati that I want to live with you as a grown, but never tell this thing to anyone as my real acquaintance. Vidyapati had got the company of the God of the world without asking. He accepted Shiva's condition. One day Vidyapati's wife Sushila gave some work to Ugna. Ugana did not understand that work properly and made a mistake.Sushila got angry with this and took out the burning wood from the stove and started beating Shiva. When Vidyapati saw this scene, unintentionally it came out of his mouth, 'This is Lord Shiva, you are killing him with burning wood.'

What was it then, as soon as this word came out of Vidyapati's mouth, Shiva disappeared from there. After this, Vidyapati started looking for Shiva, who grew like a madman, growing everywhere in the forests, in the fields. Seeing such condition of the devotee, Shiva felt pity. Lord Shiva appeared in front of Ugna and said that now I cannot live with you. I will now sit in the form of Shiva Linga as a symbol of the one who remained with you in the form of growing.
After this Shiva returned to his world and Shiva Linga appeared at that place. The famous temple of Ugna Mahadev is presently situated in Bhawanipur village in Madhubani district.
